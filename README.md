# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
The following files are those for project 0.The first aim was to exexute a test html file which says hello world. The second aim of this project is to create a website about any toppic which you personally find interesting. My website has four html pages relating to rock and metal music as it is my personal interest. These pages are called Home, Metal, Rock and Contact. Each html page has its own stylesheet which include css syntax. The Home page mainly shows the latest hits along with a profile about myself. The metal and rock pages each include a brief history of the genre along with popular artists/bands of several sub-genres. Finally, the Contact page has several social media links for which I have accounts. Features include images, videos, personal interests and social media icons as well. Most of the info was taken from wikipedia since despite my interest, my knowledge of its history was not as well updated.
